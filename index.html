            Hi, my name is <span id="FirstName"> firstName</span> <span id="LastName"> lastName</span> and my pronouns are <span id="Pronouns"> Pronouns</span>. I have been at SCC for <span id= "YearsOfStudy"> yearsOfStudy</span> months in the application development track taking JavaScript 1, Database development, Object-oriented programming, Software development tools, Project management, and Career exploration courses, and plan to be a <span id="Goal">goal</span> after completing my courses.

            A fun fact about me is that I can speak three languages including english. 
            Outside class, I enjoy watching soccer games, movies, and playing soccer sometimes even though I don't play that much nowadays.
